            WhatEverWeb or wew, is the server side tools you would need to make you site RESS. It include a image
            scaling, device detection, css and javascript compression. It's quite a nifty tool, you do a API-request
            getting the devices capabilities and render the elements needed, no more, no less. It would take care of the
            images scaling, just tell it to make this image 100% of the device width and your done. It also handles RWD
            sites break points allowing you to optimize perfectly.
