        <p>
            Do you have a place to backup your files, do you keep order in your teams developing, do you want to share
            projects with others or have a place to find great tools and snippits? GitHub is all of this.

        <p>
            GitHub is a repository of files where your code is kept track of, every change put into the repository are
            being logged, making it easy to see who's have been doing what. It will help you and your team
            collaborate by manage merges of code in a smooth and user-friendly way, at least the
            Windows application is nice. It's also a great way to get code that has already been produced, for instance;
            I want to implement parallax scrolling, well first i did it my self, but after browsing a bit I found that
            there were smoother and easier way to do it, and the code were located on GitHub. But why use GitHub? Well I
            found that the parallax scrolling code were not a perfect fit for me. So I "forked" it (a way to copy), made
            my changes and then wrote a little message and gave the code back to the developer. He could now choose to
            integrate my changes or not. That way I have help him creating a better code.
