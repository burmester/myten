        <h2>This sandbox belongs to Johan Burmester and you are very much welcome to have a look around.</h2>

        <p>
            The purpose of this site is to try out new technology, here is were I try to keep up with the development of
            new design choices, popular color pallets, cool javascript snipppets, development tools and much more.
            So far this is my forth more ambitious "mini-project" - in current time.
        </p>
        <br/>

        <p>
            The first project was created back in aug. '11 and the goal was to learn Responsive Web Design, an back then
            upcoming technology, also i want to try out HTML5 and CSS3.
            The goal behind the second project was to dive deeper into CSS3 - mainly gradients and transforms matrix -
            but I later learn it was only Chorme had the capabilities to render my site.
            The Third involved more Javascript, Ajax, Json and external API such a GoogleMaps, Google Docs,Facebook API
            and Twitter API, this was in the spring of '12. Also at this time I have graduated and started working as a
            Front-end web developer, rapid learn more about develop to mainly to other devices then desktop.

        <p>
            This is my latest project, I mainly wanted to do a replacement for my first project, it had become a rather
            old design and I had to close parts of it down. The focus of this site is the design choice "single page",
            also I wanted to use "parallax scrolling" and the pallet of 2013.
        </p>
        <br/>

        <p>
            And as a bonus I wanted to tell you about some great tools for developers. Some are old, other are new
            and upcoming, hopefully you will find some part of it interesting.
