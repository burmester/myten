        <h2>"Sass makes CSS fun again"</h2>

        <p>
            Sass is one of the more popular css preprocessor, extending your normal CSS to include variables, nesting,
            looping, conditional statements, functions and much more. All will make you life much easier, allow you write
            fast and flexible css code in ways normal css not even come close to. It's works by installing a little ruby
            application, execute a watch-command which in turn listening to changes in you scss-file and update your
            standard CSS file. Very smooth, all you need is a basic batch or shell understanding.

            Compass is much like Sass but instead of extending CSS it's extends Sass even more, giving you css3
            functions, making sprites almost automatically and more. Well, if you going to use Sass you could just as
            well use Compass, and the sprite functions is great.
